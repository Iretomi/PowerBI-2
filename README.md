# PowerBI-2
The Power BI Mapping and Data Integration Project significantly expanded my capabilities in visualizing spatial data and integrating information from diverse sources. The project equipped me with the skills to create insightful maps and seamlessly combine data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the information at hand. These newly acquired skills will undoubtedly contribute to more sophisticated and informed data analysis in future projects.

 Thank you for exploring the Power BI Mapping and Data Integration Project!
